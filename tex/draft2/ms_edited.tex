\begin{abstract}
The elemental compositions of planets define their chemistry, and could potentially be used as beacons for their formation location if the elemental gas and grain ratios of planet birth environments, i.e. protoplanetary disks, are well understood. In disks, the ratios of volatile elements, such as C/O and N/O, are regulated by the abundance of the main C, N, O carriers, their ice binding environment, and the presence of snowlines of major volatiles at different distances from the central star. We explore the effects of dynamical processes, molecular compositions and abundances, and the ice morphology of dust grains in disks on the snowline locations of the main C, O and N carriers, and their consequences for the C/N/O ratios in gas and dust throughout the disk. The gas-phase N/O ratio enhancement in the outer disk (exterior to the H$_2$O snowline) exceeds the C/O ratio enhancement for all reasonable volatile compositions. Ice morphology and disk dynamics individually change the snowline location of N$_2$, the main nitrogen carrier, by a factor of 2-3, and when considered together the range of possible N$_2$ snowline locations is $\sim$11-$\sim$79 AU in a standard disk model. The CO snowline location is similarly uncertain. This snowline location uncertainty limits the utility of C/N/O compositional ratios in planets to trace their formation zone. Observations that anchor snowline locations at different stages of planet formation are therefore key. 

%Both ice morphology and disk dynamics substantially change the disk regions where gas phase C/O and N/O are enhanced over the stellar value, and taken together they may move the CO and N$_2$ snowlines by a factor of $\sim$7 inward. Between the CO$_2$ and CO snowlines, the gaseous C/O and N/O are enhanced by factors of $\sim$$2$ and $\sim$$3$, respectively. The gas-phase N/O ratio is enhanced by many orders of magnitude between the CO and N$_2$ snowlines due to the depletion of oxygen gas in this region. Our estimates for the C/N/O ratios are moderately affected by the presence of some C in the form of CH$_4$ and of some N in the form of NH$_3$.  

%We note that N/O enhancements in disk gas can be even more extreme than C/O in the outer disk due to the low volatility of N2 compared to all major C and O carriers. I will discuss these results together with the effects of additional dynamical processes, and outline a path toward a coupled drift-desorption-chemistry model that will provide robust quantitative results for volatile snowline locations and C/N/O abundance ratios as the disk evolves in time.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

%\begin {enumerate}
The chemical composition of protoplanetary disks is largely dictated by the freeze-out of volatile species. The snowline locations of volatile molecules are therefore crucial in determining disk chemical abundances in gas and dust, as well as planet compositions.  

Carbon and oxygen bearing molecules, such as H$_2$O, CO$_2$ and CO, as well as the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio in protoplanetary disks and in giant planet atmospheres have been extensively studied from a theoretical standpoint (\citealt{oberg11}, \citealt{alidib14}, \citealt{madhu14}, \citealt{molliere15}), and snowlines of volatiles such as H$_2$O and CO have been detected (\citealt{zhang13}, \citealt{qi13}). However, disk chemistry involves many other molecular compounds \citep{henning13} including nitrogen bearing species and hydrocarbons (e.g., \citealt{mandell12}), which may affect the compositions of nascent planets.

Both in Solar system comets and in protoplanetary disks, volatile carbon and oxygen are primarily contained in H$_2$O, CO$_2$ and CO (e.g., \citealt{lodders03}, \citealt{mumma11}, \citealt{oberg11}, \citealt{boogert15}). However, some fraction of carbon may also be carried by CH$_4$ (e.g., \citealt{oberg08}), which may change the C/O ratio in gas and in dust throughout the disk. In the case of nitrogen, chemical models of the protostellar nebula (e.g., \citealt{owen01}) and of protoplanetary disks (e.g., \citealt{rodgers02}) suggest that N$_2$ was the dominant form of nitrogen, and that giant planets have accreted their nitrogen content primarily as N$_2$ \citep{mousis14}. Observations of Solar system bodies such as Titan and Pluto show that N$_2$ is prevalent in their atmospheres (\citealt{cruikshank93}, \citealt{owen93}).  Moreover, the Rosetta spacecraft has recently made the first direct measurement of the N$_2$ abundance in comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko \citep{rubin15}. In addition to N$_2$, a fraction of the nitrogen abundances may be also carried by NH$_3$ (\citealt{bottinelli10}, \citealt{mumma11}). Because of the high volatility of N$_2$, the gas phase nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) ratio in the outer disk may be even more enhanced than the C/O ratio compared to its average value in the disk. Giant planets that form at wide separations should thus have an excess of nitrogen in their atmospheres, which could be used to trace their formation origin.


The snowline locations of the main carbon, oxygen and nitrogen carriers strongly depend on the ice grain morphology. Very volatile species, such as CO and N$_2$, present binding energies, and therefore snowline locations, that are sensitive to the details of the morphology of the icy grain mantles. Laboratory experiments (\citealt{collings03}, \citealt{oberg05}, \citealt{bisschop06}, \citealt{fayolle16}) have shown that CO and N$_2$ have significantly different binding energies depending on whether they are pure or water dominated ices. This implies that ices in different environments will sublimate at different radii, which will substantially change the disk regions where these volatiles are present in gaseous or solid form (see Section \ref{sec:static}).  

%It follows that there are several important snowlines in disks, determined both by the disk composition and ice morphology. Figure \ref{fig:CNOstatic} shows an example of the H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CO, CH$_4$, NH$_3$ and N$_2$ snowlines in a static disk, with CO and N$_2$ as pure and water dominated ices, in the top and bottom panel, respectively. The ordinate displays the total carbon, oxygen and nitrogen abundance in solids as a function of the hydrogen total abundance. We note that we display this Figure here for qualitative purposes; the quantitative choices that we make for volatile abundances are discussed in Sections \ref{sec:CH4} and \ref{sec:N}. As expected, the total grain abundance increases with semimajor axis, as more and more species sublimate. More importantly, the CO and N$_2$ snowlines move several tens of AU inward if the ices are water dominated rather than pure. This changes the chemical abundances both in gas and dust throughout the disk, directly affecting the compositions of nascent giant planets forming in situ. 
 
% Disk dynamical processes such as radial drift of solids and viscous gas accretion onto the central store also change the position of the snowlines, as demonstrated by \citet{piso15b} (hereafter Paper I), which introduces another element of uncertainty in the snowline locations. 

%In order to explain this added chemical and physical complexity, a more thorough theoretical framework is needed. 

In this work, we expand the coupled drift-desorption model developed in \citet{piso15b} (hereafter Paper I) by considering additional volatile molecules and abundances, ice morphology, as well as nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) ratios. This paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{sec:review}, we review the drift-desorption model developed in Paper I. We discuss the effect of different abundances of the main carbon, oxygen and nitrogen carriers, grain morphology and disk dynamics on snowline locations and the C/N/O ratios in Section \ref{sec:results}. We address the implications of our results in Section \ref{sec:discussion} and summarize our findings in Section \ref{sec:summary}.

\section{Coupled Drift-Desorption Model}
\label{sec:review}

We begin with a brief review of Paper I's model for the effect of radial drift and viscous gas accretion on volatile snowline locations. We review our disk model in Section \ref{sec:disktime}, and summarize our numerical method and results in Section \ref{sec:driftdes}.

\subsection{Disk Model}
\label{sec:disktime}

In this work we consider both a static and a viscous disk. The static disk is irradiated by the central star and does not experience redistribution of solids or radial movement of the nebular gas. To quantify the effects of radial drift and gas accretion, we use a viscous disk with a spatially and temporally constant mass flux, $\dot{M}$. The viscous disk takes into account radial drift, gas accretion onto the central star, as well as accretion heating. We focus on this disk model which includes all the dynamical and thermal processes we are interested in for the scope of this paper, and do not further consider the other disk models presented in Paper I.  

Following \citet{chiang10}, the temperature profile for a static disk is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:diskT}
T = 120\, (r/\text{AU})^{-3/7} \,\,\text{K},
\end{equation}
%We model the static disk as a minimum mass solar nebula (MMSN), using a prescription for the gas surface density, $\Sigma$, and disk midplane temperature, $T$, similar to that of \citet{chiang10}:
%\begin{subeqnarray}
%\label{eq:disk}
%\Sigma&=&2000\, (r/\text{AU})^{-1}\,\, \text{g cm}^{-2} \slabel{eq:disksigma}\\
%T &=& 120\, (r/\text{AU})^{-3/7} \,\,\text{K}, \slabel{eq:diskT}
%\end{subeqnarray}
where $r$ is the semimajor axis. We use the \citet{shakura73}  steady-state disk solution to model the viscous disk. From Paper I, the viscous disk temperature profile is computed as % Solving the Equation set of Appendix A in Paper I yields an expression for the temperature profile in a steady-state disk:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:activeT}
T^4 =\Big[\frac{1}{4 r} \Big(\frac{3 G \kappa_0\dot{M}^2 M_* \mu m_{\rm p} \Omega_{\rm k}}{\pi^2 \alpha k_{\rm B} \sigma}\Big)^{1/3}\Big]^4 + T_{\rm irr}^4,
\end{equation}
where $T_{\rm irr}=T$ from Equation (\ref{eq:diskT}). Here $G$ is the gravitational constant, $\kappa_0=2 \times 10^{-6}$ is a dimensionless opacity coefficient, $M_*=M_{\odot}$ is the mass of the central star, $\mu=2.35$ is the mean molecular weight of the nebular gas, $m_{\rm p}$ is the proton mass, $\Omega_{\rm k}=\sqrt{G M_{\odot}/r^3}$ is the Keplerian angular velocity, $\alpha=0.01$ is a dimensionless coefficient (see below for details), $k_{\rm B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. 

%The final midplane temperature profile is computed as 
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:activeT}
%T^4 = T_{\rm act}^4 + T_{\rm irr}^4,
%\end{equation}
%where $T_{\rm irr}=T$ from Equation (\ref{eq:diskT}). We use this expression because in addition to accretion heating, stellar irradiation also contributes to the disk thermal structure. 

The steady-state disk has an $\alpha$-viscosity prescription, where the kinematic viscosity is $\nu=\alpha c H$. Here $c \equiv \sqrt{k_{\rm B} T /(\mu m_{\rm p})}$ is the isothermal sound speed (with $T$ from Equation \ref{eq:activeT}), and $H \equiv c/\Omega_{\rm k}$ is the disk scale height. We can then determine the gas surface density for a viscous disk as (\citealt{shakura73}; see also Paper I for a more detailed explanation of these calculations):
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Sigmaact}
\Sigma=\frac{\dot{M}}{3 \pi \nu}.
\end{equation}
We choose $\dot{M}=10^{-8} M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, consistent with mass flux observations in disks (e.g., \citealt{andrews10}). As described in Paper I, the mass flux rate $\dot{M}$ and stellar luminosity $L_*$ will vary throughout the disk lifetime (\citealt{kennedy06}, \citealt{chambers09}), in contrast with our simplified model which assumes that both quantities are constant. This effect will be most pronounced in the inner disk ($\lesssim$ few AU), where accretion heating dominates. We thus acknowledge that the location of the H$_2$O snowline may be determined by the decline in $\dot{M}$ or $L_*$ with time, rather than radial drift (see Paper I, Section 2.1 for a more detailed explanation). 

%In what follows, we summarize the relevant timescales that affect volatile snowline locations. 
%
%\textit{Desorption timescale.} Following \citet{hollenbach09} and Paper I, the timescale to desorb a single layer of molecules of a volatile $x$ can be approximated as
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:tdes}
%t_{\rm des}=\frac{\rho_{\rm s}}{3 \mu_x m_{\rm p}} \frac{s}{N_x R_{\rm des, x}},
%\end{equation} 
%where $\rho_{\rm s}=2$ g cm$^{-3}$ is the density of an icy particle, $s$ is the particle size, $\mu_x$ is the mean molecular weight of volatile $x$, and $N_x \approx 10^{15}$ sites cm $^{-2}$ is the number of adsorption sites of molecule $x$ per cm$^{-2}$. The desorption rate $R_{\rm des, x}$ (per molecule) is \citep{hollenbach09}
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:Rdes}
%R_{\rm{des}, x} = \nu_x \exp{(-E_x/T_{\rm grain})},
%\end{equation}
%where $E_x$ is the adsorption binding energy in units of Kelvin, $T_{\rm grain}=T$ is the grain temperature (assumed to be the same as the disk temperature, see Paper I), and $\nu_x=1.6 \times 10^{11} \sqrt{(E_x/\mu_x)}$ s$^{-1}$ is the molecule's vibrational frequency in the surface potential well. We discuss our choices for $E_x$ for the different volatile species in Sections \ref{sec:CH4} and \ref{sec:N}.

\subsection{Desorption-Drift Equations and Results}
\label{sec:driftdes}

The model is described in full in Paper I, here we review and summarize key concepts and results. For a range of initial icy grain sizes composed of a single volatile, we showed in Paper I that the timescale on which these particles desorb is comparable to their radial drift time, as well as to the accretion timescale of the nebular gas onto the central star. We thus have to take into account both drift and gas accretion when we calculate the disk location at which a particle desorbs, since that location may be different from the snowline position in a static disk for a given volatile (see Figure \ref{fig:CNOstatic} and \citealt{oberg11}). We determine a particle's final location in the disk by solving the following coupled differential equations:
\begin{subeqnarray}
\label{eq:ddt}
\frac{ds}{dt} &= & - \frac{3 \mu_x m_{\rm p}}{\rho_{\rm s}} N_x R_{\rm des, x}  \slabel{eq:dsdt} \\
\frac{dr}{dt} &=& \dot{r} \slabel{eq:drdt},
\end{subeqnarray}
where $s$ is the particle size, $t$ is time, $\mu_x$ is the mean molecular weight of volatile $x$, $\rho_{\rm s}=2$ g cm $^{-3}$ is the density of an icy particle, $N_x \approx 10^{15}$ sites cm $^{-2}$ is the number of adsorption sites of molecule $x$ per cm$^{-2}$, $R_{\rm des, x}$ is the desorption rate of species $x$, and $\dot{r}$ is the particle's radial drift velocity. We calculate $R_{\rm, des}$ and $\dot{r}$ as follows.

The desorption rate $R_{\rm des, x}$ (per molecule) is \citep{hollenbach09}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Rdes}
R_{\rm{des}, x} = \nu_x \exp{(-E_x/T_{\rm grain})},
\end{equation}
where $E_x$ is the adsorption binding energy in units of Kelvin, $T_{\rm grain}=T$ is the grain temperature (assumed to be the same as the disk temperature, see Paper I), and $\nu_x=1.6 \times 10^{11} \sqrt{(E_x/\mu_x)}$ s$^{-1}$ is the molecule's vibrational frequency in the surface potential well. We discuss our choices for $E_x$ for the different volatile species in Section \ref{sec:snowlines}.

\begin{figure*}[t!]

The total grain abundance increases with semimajor axis as more and more species freeze out.} 
\label{fig:CNOstatic}
\end{figure*}

Following \citet{chiang10} and \citet{birnstiel12}, a particle's radial drift velocity can be approximated as 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:rdotact}
\dot{r} \approx -2 \eta \Omega_{\rm k} r \Big(\frac{\tau_{\rm s}}{1+\tau_{\rm s}^2}\Big) + \frac{\dot{r}_{\rm gas}}{1+\tau_{\rm s}^2},
\end{equation}
where the first term is the drift velocity in a non-accreting disk and the second term accounts for the radial movement of the gas. Here $\eta \approx c^2/(2 v_{\rm k}^2)$, where $v_{\rm k}$ is the Keplerian velocity, and $\tau_{\rm s} \equiv \Omega_{\rm k} t_{\rm s}$ is the dimensionless stopping time:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ts}
t_{\rm s}= \left\{
\begin{array}{l l}
\rho_{\rm s} s / (\rho c), & \quad s < 9 \lambda/4 \,\,\,\ \text{Epstein drag} \\
4 \rho_{\rm s} s^2 / (9 \rho c \lambda), & \quad s < 9 \lambda/4, \,\text{Re} \lesssim 1 \,\,\,\ \text{Stokes drag,}
\end{array} 
\right.
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the disk mid-plane density, $\lambda$ is the mean free path and Re is the Reynolds number.  The gas accretion velocity $\dot{r}_{\rm gas}$ is determined from $\dot{M}=-2 \pi r \dot{r}_{\rm gas} \Sigma$, for a fixed $\dot{M}$ and with $\Sigma$ given by Equation (\ref{eq:Sigmaact}). 

For a particle of initial size $s_0$, we solve the Equation set (\ref{eq:ddt}) with the initial conditions $s(t_0)=s_0$ and $r(t_0)=r_0$, where $t_0$ is the time at which we start the integration and $r_0$ is the particle's initial location. We stop our simulation after $t_{\rm d}=3$ Myr, the disk lifetime, since this is roughly the timescale on which planets form, and determine the desorption timescale $t_{\rm des}$ from $s(t_{\rm des})=0$, and thus a particle's desorption distance $r_{\rm des}=r(t_{\rm des})$. Our results are insensitive to our choice of $t_0$ as long as $t_0 \ll t_{\rm d}$. We note that a particle's size is initially fixed and only changes due to desorption. We thus do not take into account processes such as grain coagulation or fragmentation, which nonetheless occur in disks (e.g., \citealt{birnstiel12}, \citealt{perez12}). We discuss the effect of these processes on snowline locations in Paper I.

As we show in Paper I, a particle of initial size $s_0$ can experience three outcomes after $t_{\rm d}=3$ Myr: (1) it can remain at its initial location, (2) it can drift towards the host star, then stop without evaporating significantly, and (3) it can completely desorb on a timescale shorter than 3 Myr. Particles in scenarios (1) and (2) are thus not affected by radial drift or gas accretion, and the snowline locations are those for a static disk. In contrast, the grains in case (3) desorb practically \textit{instantaneously} and \textit{at a fixed particle-size dependent location} in the disk, regardless of their initial position. The snowline locations for these particles will thus be fixed for a given initial particle size and disk model. We have found that grains with sizes $\sim0.001$ cm $\lesssim s \lesssim$ 7 m satisfy this condition for our fiducial disk. 

%\emgr{Review disk models, desorption model, relevant timescales. State that we use a steady-state disk for the coupled drift-desorption evolution, since it is the most realistic, therefore only summarize the static and steady-state (viscous) disk. Summarize the findings of Paper I, i.e. particles of certain sizes desorb instantaneously and at a fixed particle size dependent location.}

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Snowlines in a Static Disk: The Importance of Ice Morphology}
\label{sec:snowlines}

As we note in Section \ref{sec:intro}, the disk volatile composition and the ice morphology determine the location of important snowlines. In this work we focus on the primary carbon, oxygen and nitrogen carriers, i.e. H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CO, N$_2$, and to a lesser extent, CH$_4$ and NH$_3$. %To quantify the effect of the presence of some carbon in the form of CH$_4$ and of some nitrogen in the form of NH$_3$, we use measured median CH$_4$ and NH$_3$ abundances in protostellar cores from the \textit{Spitzer} c2d Legacy ice survey \citep{evans03}. 
Our standard model is based on the median ice abundances observed toward Solar-type protostars \citep{oberg11a}, which are $n_{\rm CO_2}=0.29 \times n_{\rm H_2O}$, $n_{\rm CO}=0.38 \times n_{\rm H_2O}$, $n_{\rm CH_4}=0.0555 \times n_{\rm H_2O}$ (hereafter CH$_4$-mid) and $n_{\rm NH_3}=0.055 \times n_{\rm H_2O}$ (hereafter NH$_3$-mid). Here $n_{\rm H_2O} \approx 10^{-4} \times n_{\rm H}$ is the total water abundance \citep{vandishoeck06}, with $n_{\rm H}$ the hydrogen abundance in the disk midplane. For CO, we also take into account that the observed CO ice only traces some of the CO reservoir due to its high volatility, and similarly to \citet{oberg11} and Paper I we set the total CO abundance to $0.9 \times 10^{-4} n_{\rm H}$. Finally, we assume that all nitrogen not found in NH$_3$ is in N$_2$ and assume a Solar nitrogen abundance, $n_{\rm N}=8 \times 10^{-5} n_{\rm H}$ \citep{lodders03}. In effect, this model assumes no chemical evolution between the protostellar and disk midplane stages. This is reasonable for material that accretes onto the disk at large radii \citep{visser09}, but may overestimate the contribution of the original volatiles to the total volatile budget in the innermost disk. 

We determine the location of the H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CO, CH$_4$, N$_2$ and NH$_3$ snowlines in our static disk by balancing desorption with readsorption, following \citet{hollenbach09}. The binding energies of H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CO, CH$_4$, N$_2$ and NH$_3$ as pure ices are 5800 K, 2000 K, 834 K, 1300 K, 767 K and 2965 K, respectively (\citealt{fraser01}, \citealt{collings04}, \citealt{fayolle16}, \citealt{garrod06}, \citealt{martin14}). For CO and N$_2$ as water dominated ices, the binding energies are 1388 K and 1266 K, respectively \citep{fayolle16}. Figure \ref{fig:CNOstatic} shows the resulting snowline locations, with CO and N$_2$ pure ices (top panel) and water dominated ices (bottom panel). The ordinate displays the total carbon, oxygen and nitrogen abundance in solids as a function of the hydrogen total abundance.  As expected, the total grain abundance increases with semimajor axis, as more and more species freeze out. Freeze-out at the CO$_2$ and CO snowlines pulls more heavy elements into the grains than in the case of the H$_2$O snowline.  The CO and N$_2$ snowlines move several tens of AU inward if the ices are water dominated rather than pure. This changes the chemical abundances both in gas and dust throughout the disk, directly affecting the compositions of nascent giant planets forming in situ.

%It follows that there are several important snowlines in disks, determined both by the disk composition and ice morphology. Figure \ref{fig:CNOstatic} shows an example of the H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CO, CH$_4$, NH$_3$ and N$_2$ snowlines in a static disk, with CO and N$_2$ as pure and water dominated ices, in the top and bottom panel, respectively. 

\subsection{C/N/O Ratios in Static Disks}
\label{sec:static}

In this section we determine the C/O and N/O ratios in gas and dust throughout our static disk, and to what extent they are affected by the presence of CH$_4$ and NH$_3$ over the full range of observed CH$_4$ and NH$_3$ abundances. Since here we are primarily interested in the magnitude of the C/N/O ratios rather than snowline locations (which have been discussed in Section \ref{sec:snowlines}), we assume for simplicity that CO and N$_2$ are pure ices. 

We explore the parameter space of possible CH$_4$ abundances by assuming three different scenarios: (1) no CH$_4$, (2) CH$_4$-mid, and (3) the maximum CH$_4$ observed abundance (hereafter CH$_4$-max), $n_{\rm CH_4-max}=0.13 \times n_{\rm H_2O}$ \citep{oberg08}, where $n_{\rm H_2O}$ is the total H$_2$O abundance. %Similarly to Paper I, we use the H$_2$O, CO$_2$ and CO abundances of \citet{oberg11}. 
Since the abundance of carbon grains is uncertain, we assume that all the carbon that is not in the form of CH$_4$, CO and CO$_2$ is in carbon grains, so that we reproduce the Solar C/O ratio (gas+dust) of 0.54.  

Figure \ref{fig:COstatic} shows the C/O ratio in gas and dust as a function of semimajor axis in a static disk: no CH$_4$ (top panel), CH$_4$-mid (middle panel) and CH$_4$-max (bottom panel). As in \citet{oberg11} and Paper I, a gaseous C/O ratio of unity can be achieved between the CO$_2$ and CO snowlines, where oxygen gas is significantly depleted. The gas-phase C/O ratio may be further enhanced between the CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ snowlines due to the presence of additional carbon gas from CH$_4$. In this region, the C/O ratio increases by 3\% for CH$_4$-mid and by 8\% for CH$_4$-max, as displayed in the middle and bottom panels of Figure \ref{fig:COstatic}. Based on the range of observed CH$_4$ protostellar abundances, its presence in the disk only modestly affects the C/O ratio. %Given the larger uncertainties in overall volatile abundances, we can neglect CH$_4$ when estimating the C/O ratio in disks.

We assume that the main nitrogen-bearing species are N$_2$ and NH$_3$, since other volatiles that contain nitrogen have significantly lower abundances in comparison (e.g., \citealt{mumma11}). Similarly to the case of CH$_4$, we explore the parameter space of possible NH$_3$ abundances using observations of protostellar cores, as follows: (1) no NH$_3$, (2) NH$_3$-mid, and (3) the maximum observed NH$_3$ abundance $n_{\rm NH_3-max}=0.15 \times n_{\rm H_2O}$ \citep{bottinelli10}. In each case, the N$_2$ abundance then simply follows as $n_{\rm N_2}=(n_{\rm N}-n_{\rm NH_3})/2$. 

%Both in Solar system comets and in protoplanetary disks, carbon and oxygen are primarily contained in H$_2$O, CO$_2$ and CO (e.g., \citealt{rodgers02}, \citealt{lodders03}, \citealt{pontoppidan06}). However, some fraction of the carbon abundance may also be carried by CH$_4$ (e.g., \citealt{mumma96}), which may change the C/O ratio in gas and in dust throughout the disk. 
%To quantify the magnitude of this effect, we use measured CH$_4$ abundances in protostellar cores from the \textit{Spitzer} c2d Legacy ice survey \citep{evans03}. We explore the parameter space of possible CH$_4$ abundances by assuming three different scenarios: (1) no CH$_4$, (2) the median CH$_4$ observed abundance (hereafter CH$_4$-mid), and (3) the maximum CH$_4$ observed abundance (hereafter CH$_4$-max). Thus $n_{\rm CH_4-mid}=0.0555 \times n_{\rm H_2O}$ \citep{oberg11a} and $n_{\rm CH_4-max}=0.13 \times n_{\rm H_2O}$ \citep{oberg08}, where $n_{\rm H_2O}$ is the total H$_2$O abundance. Similarly to Paper I, we use the H$_2$O, CO$_2$ and CO abundances of \citet{oberg11}. Since the abundance of carbon grains is uncertain, we assume that all the carbon that is not in the form of CH$_4$, CO and CO$_2$ is in carbon grains, so that we reproduce the Solar C/O ratio (gas+dust) of 0.54.  

%We determine the location of the H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CO, CH$_4$, N$_2$ and NH$_3$ snowlines in our static disk by balancing desorption with readsorption, following \citet{hollenbach09}. The binding energies of H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CO, CH$_4$ and N$_2$ as pure ices are 5800 K, 2000 K, 834 K, 1300 K, respectively (\citealt{fraser01}, \citealt{collings04}, \citealt{fayolle16}, \citealt{garrod06}).





%Nitrogen is another abundant volatile in the Solar system and in disks. Chemical models of the protostellar nebula (e.g., \citealt{owen01}) and of protoplanetary disks (e.g., \citealt{rodgers02}) suggest that N$_2$ was the dominant form of nitrogen, and that giant planets have accreted their nitrogen content primarily as N$_2$ \citep{mousis14}. Observations of Solar system bodies such as Titan and Pluto show that N$_2$ is prevalent in their atmospheres (\citealt{cruikshank93}, \citealt{owen93}).  Moreover, the Rosetta spacecraft has recently made the first direct measurement of the N$_2$ abundance in comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko \citep{rubin15}. In addition to N$_2$, a fraction of the nitrogen abundances may be also carried by NH$_3$ (\citealt{bottinelli10}, \citealt{mumma11}). 

%Because of the high volatility of N$_2$, the gas phase nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) ratio in the outer disk
%may be even more enhanced than the C/O ratio compared to its average value in the disk. Giant planets that form at wide separations should thus have an excess of nitrogen in their atmospheres, which could be used to trace their formation origin.  
%In this study, we quantify this effect in protoplanetary disks. We assume that the main nitrogen-bearing species are N$_2$ and NH$_3$, since other volatiles that contain nitrogen have significantly lower abundances in comparison (e.g., \citealt{mumma11}). We use the measured total nitrogen abundance in the Solar system, $n_{\rm N}=8 \times 10^{-5} n_{\rm H}$ \citep{lodders03}, where $n_{\rm H}$ is the hydrogen abundance in the disk midplane. Similarly to the case of CH$_4$ (see Section \ref{sec:CH4}), we explore the parameter space of possible NH$_3$ abundances using data from the Spitzer c2d Legacy ice survey, as follows: (1) no NH$_3$, (2) the median NH$_3$ observed abundance $n_{\rm NH_3-mid}=0.055 \times n_{\rm H_2O}$ \citep{oberg11a}, and (3) the maximum observed NH$_3$ abundance $n_{\rm NH_3-max}=0.1537 \times n_{\rm H_2O}$ \citep{bottinelli10}. In each case, the N$_2$ abundance then simply follows as $n_{\rm N_2}=(n_{\rm N}-n_{\rm NH_3})/2$. We determine the locations of the N$_2$ and NH$_3$ snowlines by balancing desorption with readsorption \citep{hollenbach09}, with N$_2$ and NH$_3$ pure ice binding energies of  767 K and  2965 K, respectively (\citealt{fayolle16}, \citealt{martin14}).

\label{fig:Nstatic}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:Nstatic} shows the snowline locations of the main oxygen and nitrogen carriers and the N/O ratio in gas and dust as a function of semimajor axis in a static disk, for our three choices of the NH$_3$ abundance: no NH$_3$ (top panel), NH$_3$-mid (middle panel) and NH$_3$-max (bottom panel). For comparison, the horizontal dashed lines show the average N/O ratio in the disk. As expected, the gaseous N/O ratio generally exhibits an increasing trend towards the outer disk as more oxygen gas is depleted, with small decreases between the NH$_3$ and CO$_2$ snowlines (by 6\% for NH$_3$-mid and by 18\% for NH$_3$-max, respectively) due to NH$_3$ freeze-out. While the presence of NH$_3$ only moderately affects our results for the N/O ratio, NH$_3$ is important since otherwise the nitrogen content in solid bodies would be more depleted than is observed for comets and asteroids (\citealt{wyckoff91}, \citealt{mumma11}, \citealt{bergin15}).

The gas-phase N/O ratio is enhanced by a factor of two outside the H$_2$O snowline compared to its average value, by more than a factor of three between the CO$_2$ and CO snowlines, and by orders of magnitude between the CO and N$_2$ snowlines. This latter region can span tens of AU depending on disk parameters and the relative CO and N$_2$ ice binding environment. This enhancement is more pronounced than the C/O gas phase enhancement of a factor of two in the outer disk (see Figure \ref{fig:COstatic}). %The N/O ratio reaches particularly high values between the CO and N$_2$ snowlines, where all the oxygen is now contained in grains. 

\subsection{C/N/O Ratios in Dynamic Disks}
\label{sec:dynamic}

%As noted in Section \ref{sec:intro}, the CO binding energy varies significantly depending on the morphology of the icy grains. If CO ice is in a water dominated environment, its binding energy will be larger than in the pure ice case (834 K) due to the higher binding energy of CO to H$_2$O than to other CO molecules. \citet{fayolle16} find a CO binding energy of 1388 K in the water dominated ice scenario. 


Here we use the model of Section \ref{sec:review} to estimate the movement of the CO and N$_2$ snowlines for different grain morphologies in a viscous disk. Figure \ref{fig:CO_ratio} shows the H$_2$O, CO$_2$ and CO snowline locations for particles with initial sizes $\sim0.06$ cm $\lesssim s \lesssim$ 7 m as well as estimates for the C/O ratio in gas and dust in a viscous disk, with the CO snowline calculated under different grain morphologies as noted above. We assume there is no carbon in the form of CH$_4$. The true snowline for particles that desorb outside the static snowline is the static snowline itself, hence desorbing particles with $s<0.06$ cm do not form true snowlines. If the CO binding environment is known, the CO snowline moves inward by up to $\sim$50 \% compared to a static disk for each case (pure and water dominated ices) due to disk dynamics. The full range of potential CO snowlines taking into account both ice morphology and disk dynamics span $\sim$8.7 AU to $\sim$61 AU, which is a factor of $\sim$7 difference. This implies that gas phase C/O ratios of order unity may be reached in the giant planet forming zone, and the CO snowline may be inside 10 AU for certain disk parameters.  

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{C_O_water_ice.pdf}
%\vspace{-0.5in}
\caption{C/O ratio estimates in gas (solid lines) and dust (dashed lines) as function of semimajor axis in a viscous disk, for CO as pure ice (top panel) or as water dominated ices (bottom panel). The H$_2$O, CO$_2$ and CO snowlines are shown for particles with initial sizes $\sim0.001$ cm $\lesssim s \lesssim$ 7 m as indicated by the color bar. The C/O ratio in a static disk (black lines) is shown for comparison. The arrows show that the C/O ratio in gas will decrease inside the H$_2$O and CO$_2$
snowlines in the viscous disk, as the relative fluxes of the desorbed icy
particles and the overall nebular gas will cause an excess of oxygen gas inside these snowlines (see Paper I for details). The presence of CO in a water ice environment rather than as pure ice moves the CO snowline significantly inward by $\sim$70\%. Taken together, disk dynamics and ice morphology move the CO snowline inward by a factor of $\sim$7.} 
\label{fig:CO_ratio}
\end{figure}

%As in the case for CO, the N$_2$ binding energy is also strongly dependent on the ice environment in which the grain resides. If N$_2$ is a water dominated ice, the N$_2$ binding energy is 1266 K \citep{fayolle16}. 

Figure \ref{fig:NO_ratio} shows the H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CO and N$_2$ snowline locations in a viscous disk for the same range of initial particle sizes as in Figure \ref{fig:CO_ratio}, and with the CO and N$_2$ snowlines calculated assuming different grain morphologies as explained above, as well as estimates for the N/O ratio throughout the disk. For simplicity, we assume that all nitrogen is the form of N$_2$. This choice is justified since the presence of some NH$_3$ only moderately changes the N/O ratio (see Figure \ref{fig:Nstatic}), and since we are primarily interested in the N$_2$ snowline locations rather than exact values for the N/O ratio. The innermost N$_2$ snowlines in the viscous disk, created by particles with $s \sim 7$ m for our fiducial model, are located at $r_{\rm N_2, pure} \approx 42$ AU for N$_2$ as pure ice and at $r_{\rm N_2, water} \approx 11$ AU for N$_2$ in water dominated ices. Thus for each case (pure versus water dominated ices), the N$_2$ snowline moves inward by up to 50\% due to disk dynamics. By taking into account both ice morphology and disk dynamics, the full range of potential N$_2$ snowlines span $\sim$11 to $\sim$79 AU, which is a factor of $\sim$7 difference. Similarly to the case for CO, the N$_2$ snowline may be close to 10 AU for certain disk models.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

%\emgr{Discuss how entrapment of volatiles by H2O affects volatile abundances and C/O ratios. Re-emphasize the fact that the C/O and N/O ratios are upper estimates, and that CH4 and NH3 might matter in a viscous disk. State that we plan to address this in a future paper. More TBD.}
This study shows that the gas-phase N/O ratio in protoplanetary disks is considerably enhanced throughout most of the disk midplane compared to its average value. As demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:enhance}, the gaseous N/O ratio is enhanced by a factor of two beyond the H$_2$O snowline, by more than a factor of three between the CO$_2$ and CO snowlines, and by several orders of magnitude between the CO and N$_2$ snowlines. Thus constraining the N/O ratio in a giant planet atmosphere could be used to trace its formation origins. 

Theoretical models of the magnitude and role of N/O (and N/C) ratios in exoplanet atmospheres are therefore key in order to use these ratios as probes for a planet's formation location. Models that explore the effect of varying the C/O ratio in exoplanet atmospheres exist in literature, and they display a large and observable effect on gas giant envelope chemistry (\citealt{lodders09}, \citealt{molliere15}). However, no similar model explorations exist for the effect of N/O and C/N/O ratios, and both are needed to exploit this potential constraint. Given the existence of such theoretical models, measurements of the N/O ratio in planetary envelopes may be possible to infer from atmospheric compositions of nitrogen versus carbon and oxygen bearing species. Nitrogen carriers have not been targeted so far due to lack of instrument sensitivity, but such observations and detections are likely in the near future with the advent of JWST (e.g., NH$_3$, \citealt{greene16}). The N/O ratio enhancement is larger than that of the gas phase C/O ratio throughout most of the disk. Thus measurements of an enhanced C/O ratio in an exoplanet atmosphere could be corroborated (disproved) by measurements of enhanced (non-enhanced) N/O ratios. Moreover, Figure \ref{fig:enhance} shows that giant planets that have formed in situ between the H$_2$O and CO snowlines are expected to present elevated both C/O and N/O ratios in their atmospheres, whereas planets between the CO and N$_2$ snowlines will have a highly enhanced N/O ratio in their atmospheres, but not C/O.

\end{figure}




Due to disk dynamics and ice morphology, the locations of the CO and N$_2$ snowlines, and thus the disk regions with highly elevated gas phase N/O and C/O ratios, are uncertain and may span tens of AU. Both ice morphologies discussed in this study, pure and water dominated ices, are plausible in protoplanetary disks and depend on whether H$_2$O and CO ices formed on similar timescales or successively (e.g., \citealt{garrod11}). Observations of protostellar cores show that a large fraction of CO is bound in a pure ice multilayer \citep{pontoppidan03}, but theoretical models also suggest an icy mantle structure where CO resides on a H$_2$O ice layer (e.g., \citealt{collings03}). One can also imagine a scenario where CO is in a water binding environment and N$_2$ is not. This could be attributed to the fact that H$_2$O may bind preferentially to CO than N$_2$, since both H$_2$O and CO are polar molecules while N$_2$ is not. It is also possible for N$_2$ ices to form later than CO (e.g., \citealt{pagani12}), and thus be deposited on the outer layers of the icy mantles which are typically water poor (e.g., \citealt{garrod11}). The impact of the ice environment on the snowline location is much smaller in the case of CO$_2$ and NH$_3$, as their binding energies and behavior are closer to that of H$_2$O. No detailed measurements for the CH$_4$ binding energy in a water environment exist so far, but due to its low desorption temperature a similar behavior to that of CO and N$_2$ would be expected. While the presence of some carbon in the form of CH$_4$ only modestly affects our results, CH$_4$ may become important in disks where a large fraction of the CO abundance has been converted into hydrocarbons (e.g., \citealt{du15}). 

Changes in stellar luminosity (e.g., \citealt{kennedy06}) and gas mass accretion rate (e.g., \citealt{chambers09}), as well as the evolution of icy dust particles due to grain growth and fragmentation (e.g., \citealt{birnstiel12}), may introduce additional uncertainties in the snowline locations, and thus the C/N/O ratios. Given the number of uncertainties in snowline locations, detections of snowlines in a sample of disks at different evolutionary stages are needed to provide observational constraints. The uncertainties in snowline locations caused by disk dynamics, ice morphology, and other effects outlined above can be resolved in extreme cases, such as a detection of a CO snowline at a temperature corresponding to pure CO ice desorption in a static disk (e.g., \citealt{qi13} at $\sim$ 17 K). In other cases, however, the degeneracies in snowline locations cannot be broken. For example, the CO snowline in HD 163296 is at a higher temperature of $\sim$ 25 K \citep{qi15}, which could be caused either by CO being in a water dominated environment or by dynamical effects that push the CO snowline inward. Detections of both the CO and N$_2$ snowlines in the same disk could potentially break this degeneracy, since CO and N$_2$ desorb at substantially different temperatures, and therefore locations, if the former is water dominated and the latter is in a pure ice environment. 

%Current detections include the H$_2$O snowline in TW Hya \citep{zhang13} and the CO snowline in TW Hya \citep{qi13} and HD 163296 \citep{qi15}. More snowline detections in disks of different ages are expected in future ALMA cycles.  Snowline observations may also be used to constrain the degree of turbulence in protoplanetary disks \citep{owen14}. We note, however, that observations of snowlines may not be enough to break the degeneracies in snowline locations produced by disk dynamics, ice morphology, and other effects outlined above. For example, a detection of the CO snowline at a temperature higher than the assumed desorption temperature in a static disk with CO as pure ice ($\sim$17 K, e.g. \citealt{qi13}) could be caused either by CO being in a water dominated environment or by dynamical effects that push the CO snowline inward. This degeneracy can be broken in extreme cases --- for our fiducial disk model, this implies a detection of a CO snowline close to $\sim$9 AU or $\sim$61 AU (see Section \ref{sec:dynamic}). 


 %The impact of the ice environment on the snowline location is much smaller in the case of CO$_2$ and NH$_3$, as their binding energies and behavior are closer to that of H$_2$O. No detailed measurements for the CH$_4$ binding energy in a water environment exist so far, but due to its low desorption temperature a similar behavior to that of CO and N$_2$ would be expected. While the presence of some carbon in the form of CH$_4$ only modestly affects our results, CH$_4$ may become important in disks where a large fraction of the CO abundance has been converted into hydrocarbons (e.g., \citealt{du15}).   %It is thus crucial to build a quantitative framework to explore the range of snowline locations and thus gaseous C/N/O ratios across disks with different dynamics and grain morphologies, as such models are currently lacking. %The theoretical expectations for N/O ratios in disks and giant planets may be further constrained by future JWST observations of exoplanet atmospheric spectra and detections of nitrogen bearing species (e.g., NH$_3$, \citealt{greene16}).   

Uncertainties in snowline locations of this magnitude also affect interpretations of Solar system observations. Recent measurements of nitrogen abundance in comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko found a N$_2$/CO ratio $\sim 10^{-3}$ \citep{rubin15}. A low N$_2$/CO ratio is consistent with comets having formed inside the N$_2$ snowline where N$_2$ is still in the gas phase. Theoretical models suggest that Jupiter-family comets, such as 67P, originate from the Kuiper belt \citep{duncan97} (but see \citealt{rubin15} for alternative formation scenarios for 67P). It is thus possible, in principle, to use measurements of the N$_2$ abundance in Jupiter-family comets to determine where the N$_2$ snowline was located in our Solar system. However due to the uncertainty in the calculated location of the N$_2$ snowline (see Section \ref{sec:dynamic}), more detailed modeling is needed. 

%Finally, detections of snowlines in disks that are reasonably well characterized could help further constrain the dynamics and ice morphology in the disks.    


\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

In this paper we explore the role of icy grain morphology and disk dynamics on the snowline locations of major volatile carrier molecules and the C/N/O ratios in protoplanetary disks. We enhance the coupled drift-desorption model developed in \citet{piso15b} by adding more carbon- and nitrogen-bearing species into our framework and by considering different binding ice environments. Our results can be summarized as follows:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Due to the high volatility of N$_2$, the gaseous N/O ratio outside the H$_2$O snowline is enhanced by a factor of two compared to its average value, by more than a factor of three between the CO$_2$ and CO snowlines, and by many orders of magnitude between the CO and N$_2$ snowlines doe to the complete depletion of oxygen gas in this region. This enhancement is more pronounced than in the case of the gas-phase C/O ratio, which is increased by at most a factor of two compared to the stellar value. %Moreover, the N/O ratio in gas is expected to be very large between the CO and N$_2$ snowlines due to the complete depletion of oxygen gas in this region

\item The effect of CH$_4$ and NH$_3$ on the C/O and N/O ratios is small, even when we consider the maximum observed CH$_4$ and NH$_3$ abundances in protostellar cores. In this scenario, the gas phase C/O ratio increases by 8\% between the CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ snowlines, and  the gaseous N/O ratio increases by up to 18\% between the NH$_3$ and CO$_2$ snowlines. In both cases, large gas phase C/O and N/O ratios in the outer disk are preserved.

\item Grain composition sensitively affects the CO and N$_2$ snowline locations. If CO and N$_2$ are water dominated rather than pure ices, their snowlines move inward by up to $\sim$70 \%. This effect is separate from that of radial drift and viscous gas accretion, which also cause an inward movement of the CO and N$_2$ snowlines by up to $\sim$50 \%. 

\item The locations of the CO and N$_2$ snowlines are uncertain when we consider both viscous versus static disks, and pure versus water dominated ices. The snowlines in a viscous disk with CO or N$_2$ in a water environment are by up to a factor of $\sim$7 closer to the host star that in a static disk with CO or N$_2$ as pure ices. 

\end{enumerate}

Our results have direct consequences for the composition of nascent giant planets. The considerable inward movement of the CO and N$_2$ snowlines due to the ice grains being water dominated rather than pure ices implies than giant planets with high C/O and/or N/O ratios in their atmospheres may form closer in than previously predicted by theoretical models. Moreover, our model shows that wide separation gas giants may have an excess of nitrogen in their envelopes, which may be used to trace their origins. In future work, we plan to add new levels of complexity to our model in terms of disk chemistry, dynamics, and planetary dynamics, thus forming a solid framework for understanding the origins of gas giants.

%\subsection{Nitrogen and CH4}
%
%\emgr{Discuss that nitrogen is abundant in the solar system and should be abundant in disks as well, but that its dominant form is largely unknown. Discuss that the main carrier of nitrogen is N2, but some fraction of it can be NH3 as well. Present and motivate the choices that we make for NH3 abundances. Along the same lines, discuss CH4, and the choices that we make for CH4 abundances.}
%
%\subsection{Volatile Desorption Energies}
%
%\emgr{State that desorption energies for H2O and CO2 are well constrained experimentally, and that the CO2 binding energy is only weakly dependent on whether it's pure CO2 or combined with H2O, but that is not the case for CO, N2 (and perhaps CH4 and NH3?). Briefly discuss CO-CO, N2-N2, CO-H2O and N2-H2O (and perhaps the same for CH4 and NH3 if we find literature on that) experimental results for binding energies, and motivate the choices that we make.}

%\subsection{Results for C/O and N/O in a Static Disk}
%
%\emgr{For each of them (C/O and N/O), show a 3-panel plot as follows: each panel has a specific CH4/NH3 abundance (top: none, middle: median abundance, bottom: maximum abundance); for a given panel, have multiple curves for C/O or N/O, depending on the choice of binding energies, so that it's clear visually how the binding energy changes the snowline location. Discuss how different abundances  and binding energies affect snowline locations and C/O or N/O ratios.}

%\emgr{One multipanel 3x3 (or 3x2) rainbow plot similar to the snowline plots from Paper I, for \textit{one} choice for the binding energies (perhaps the largest ones, since we want a limit on how far in we can push the snowlines?). Rows: snowlines as a function or particle size for passive, active and (maybe) steady-state disk. Columns: N2, NH3 and CH4. Not entirely certain how necessary these plots/subsection actually are, since it is exactly the same qualitatively as in Paper I...}
%
%\subsection{C/O and N/O Ratios}
%
%\emgr{For each of them (C/O and N/O) show a 3x3 multipanel plot similar to the C/O plot from Paper I, for the same choice of binding energies as in the previous subsection. Columns: C/O or N/O in passive, active and steady-state disk. Rows: No CH4/NH3, median CH4/NH3, maximum CH4/NH3. Again, not sure if we need/want this for all disk choices, at least in the case of C/O since we already have that in Paper I. For N/O, quantify how the snowline location changes from a static disk due to drift and gas accretion.}
