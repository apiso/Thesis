The dashed curve for accretion energy indicates a negative contribution. All quantities are evaluated at the RCB, except for $L_{\rm negl}$, the extra luminosity that would have been generated in the radiative zone, but is neglected in our model. The neglected luminosity is a small correction to the model luminosity $L$ for $M_{\rm atm} \lesssim 3 M_{\oplus }$.
